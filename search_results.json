    "abstract": "Surgical video synthesis offers a cost-effective way to expand training data and enhance the performance of machine learning models in computer-assisted surgery. However, existing video translation methods often produce video sequences with large illumination changes across different views, disrupting the temporal consistency of the videos. Additionally, these methods typically synthesize videos with a monotonous style, whereas diverse synthetic data is desired to improve the generalization ability of downstream machine learning models. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Controllable Illumination Invariant Generative Adversarial Network (CIIGAN) for generating diverse, illumination-consistent video sequences. CIIGAN fuses multi-scale illumination-invariant features from a novel controllable illumination-invariant (CII) image space with multi-scale texture-invariant features from self-constructed 3D scenes. The CII image space, along with the 3D scenes, allows CIIGAN to produce diverse and temporally-consistent video or image translations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CIIGAN achieves more realistic and illumination-consistent translations compared to previous state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, the segmentation networks trained on our diverse synthetic data outperform those trained on monotonous synthetic data. Our source code, well-trained models, and 3D simulation scenes are public available at https://github.com/LongChenCV/CIIGAN.",

    "abstract": "The conformational ensemble of a molecule is strongly influenced by the surrounding environment. Correctly modeling the effect of any given environment is, hence, of pivotal importance in computational studies. Machine learning (ML) has been shown to be able to model these interactions probabilistically, with successful applications demonstrated for classical molecular dynamics. While first instances of ML implicit solvents for quantum-mechanical (QM) calculations exist, the high computational cost of QM reference calculations hinders the development of a generally applicable ML implicit solvent model for QM calculations. Here, we present a novel way of developing such a general machine-learned QM implicit solvent model by transferring knowledge obtained from classical interactions to QM, emulating a QM/MM setup with electrostatic embedding and a nonpolarizable MM solvent. This has the profound advantages that neither QM/MM reference calculations nor experimental data are required for training and that the obtained graph neural network (GNN)-based implicit solvent model (termed QM-GNNIS) is compatible with any functional and basis set. QM-GNNIS is currently applicable to small organic molecules and describes 39 different organic solvents. The performance of QM-GNNIS is validated on NMR and IR experiments, demonstrating that the approach can reproduce experimentally observed trends unattainable by state-of-the-art implicit-solvent models paired with static QM calculations.",

    "abstract": "Predicting the original mass of a retouched scraper has long been a major goal in lithic analysis. It is commonly linked to lithic technological organization of past societies along with notions of stone tool general morphology, standardization through the reduction process, use life, and site occupation patterns. In order to obtain a prediction of original stone tool mass, previous studies have focused on attributes that would remain constant or unaltered through retouch episodes. However, these approaches have provided limited success for predictions and have also remained untested in the framework of successive resharpening episodes. In the research presented here, a set of experimentally knapped flint flakes were successively resharpened as scraper types. After each resharpening episode, four attributes were recorded (scraper mass, height of retouch, maximum thickness and the GIUR index). Four machine learning models were trained using these variables in order to estimate the mass of the flake prior to any retouch. A Random Forest model provided the best results with an [Formula: see text] value of 0.97 when predicting original flake mass, and a [Formula: see text] value of 0.84 when predicting percentage of mass lost by retouch. The Random Forest model has been integrated into an open source and free to use Shiny app. This allows for the wide spread implementation of a highly precise machine learning model for predicting initial mass of flake blanks successively retouched into scrapers.",

    "abstract": "Clinical coding translates medical information from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) into structured codes such as ICD-10, which are essential for healthcare applications. Advances in deep learning and natural language processing have enabled automatic ICD coding models to achieve notable accuracy metrics on in-domain datasets when adequately trained. However, the scarcity of clinical medical texts and the variability across different datasets pose significant challenges, making it difficult for current state-of-the-art models to ensure robust generalization performance across diverse data distributions. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-4o, have shown great generalization capabilities across general domains and potential in medical information processing tasks. However, their performance in generating clinical codes remains suboptimal. In this study, we propose a novel ICD coding paradigm based on code verification to leverage the capabilities of LLMs. Instead of directly generating accurate codes from a vast code space, we simplify the task by verifying the code assignment from a given candidate set. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that LLMs function more effectively as code verifiers rather than code generators, with GPT-4o achieving the best performance on the CodiEsp dataset under zero-shot settings. Furthermore, our results indicate that LLM-based systems can perform on par with state-of-the-art clinical coding systems while offering superior generalizability across institutions, languages, and ICD versions.",

    "abstract": "Cryptorchidism, a common male reproductive disorder characterized by undescended testes, is associated with infertility and increased cancer risk. While its etiology remains incompletely understood, accumulating evidence suggests that immune-inflammatory responses contribute to disease progression. This study investigated the role of carboxypeptidase N subunit 2 (CPN2) in modulating immune activation and testicular pathology via the NF-κB signaling pathway. Key regulatory genes were identified through transcriptomic analysis, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), and machine learning approaches. A di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP)-induced rat model of cryptorchidism and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated CPN2 knockout rats were employed, alongside histological, immunohistochemical, Western blotting, and co-culture assays to explore immune activation and spermatogonial cell fate. CPN2 was identified as a pivotal factor that suppresses NF-κB activation and plasma cell infiltration. Its overexpression alleviated inflammatory cytokine production, preserved spermatogonial stem cell proliferation, and reduced apoptosis in both in vivo and in vitro models. These effects were reversed upon NF-κB activation, confirming the regulatory role of the CPN2/NF-κB axis. Our findings reveal that CPN2 mitigates cryptorchidism progression by modulating immune-inflammatory responses, highlighting it as a promising molecular target for non-surgical intervention in this condition.",

    "abstract": "Sequence-based AI models show great potential for prediction of variant effects at high resolution, but their practical value in plant breeding remains to be confirmed through rigorous validation studies. Plant breeding has traditionally relied on phenotyping to select individuals with desirable traits-a process that is both costly and time-consuming. Increasingly, breeding strategies are shifting toward precision breeding, where causal variants are directly targeted based on their effects. To predict the effects of causal variants, in silico methods are emerging as efficient alternatives or complements to mutagenesis screens. Here, we review state-of-the-art machine learning methods for predicting variant effects in plants across both coding and noncoding regions, contrasting supervised approaches in functional genomics with unsupervised methods in comparative genomics. We discuss challenges in validating predictions, and compare these methods with traditional association and comparative genomics techniques. We argue that modern sequence models extend traditional methods by generalizing across genomic contexts, fitting a unified model across loci rather than a separate model for each locus. In doing so, they address inherent limitations of traditional quantitative and evolutionary comparative genetics techniques. However, the accuracy and generalizability of sequence models heavily depend on the training data, highlighting the need for validation experiments. We point to successful applications of sequence models, especially with protein sequences, and identify areas for further improvement, especially in modeling regulatory sequences. While not yet mature for in silico-driven precision breeding, sequence models show strong potential to become an integral part of the breeder's toolbox.",

    "abstract": "Production and validation of an open global ensemble digital terrain model (GEDTM30) and derived terrain variables at 1 arc-s spacing grid ( ∼ 30 m spatial resolution) is described. Copernicus DEM, ALOS World3D, and object height models were combined in a data fusion approach to generate a globally consistent digital terrain model (DTM). This DTM was then used to compute 15 standard terrain variables across six scales (30, 60, 120, 240, 480 and 960 m). A global-to-local transfer learning model framework with 5° × 5° tiling leveraged globally distributed lidar datasets: ICESat-2 ATL08 (best-fit terrain height) and GEDI02 (lowest mode elevation), totaling over 30 billion training points. A global model was initially fitted using ICESat-2 and GEDI, followed by locally optimized models per tile, ensuring both global consistency and local accuracy. Independent validation shows that GEDTM30 reduces Copernicus DEM RMSE by about 25.4% in built-up areas, 10.0% in regions with 10-50% tree cover, and 27.3% in areas with over 50% tree cover. Compared to state-of-the-art DTMs (MERIT DEM, FABDEM and FathomDEM), GEDTM30 achieves the lowest vertical errors when assessed with GNSS station records, yielding a standard deviation of 7.77 m, an RMSE of 10.69 m, and a mean error of 7.34 m. FathomDEM exhibited the lowest vertical RMSE when validated against independent reference DTMs. GEDTM30 was further used to generate multiscale variables of topography and hydrology through an optimized tiling workflow ( ∼ 800 tiles of 600 × 600 km with ∼ 16% overlap) based on the Equi7 grid system. The entire workflow was implemented in Python using GDAL and Whitebox Workflows. Visual inspection confirmed the absence of boundary artifacts and the preservation of hydrologic connectivity. The tiling-based implementation significantly reduces computational costs of generating large-scale DTMs and derived terrain variables. The GEDTM30 dataset and code are publicly available as Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFFs via Zenodo and the OpenLandMap STAC. Further fusion with local lidar-based DTMs and national DTMs is recommended to enhance local accuracy and level of detail.",

    "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40718623/",
    "abstract": "Addressing inpainting challenges in high-resolution images remains a complex task. The most recent image inpainting techniques rely on machine learning models; however, a major limitation of supervised methods is their dependence on end-to-end training. Even minor changes to the input often necessitate retraining, making the process inefficient. As a result, unsupervised learning approaches have gained prominence in image inpainting. State-of-the-art methods, particularly those using generative adversarial networks (GANs), have achieved promising results. However, generating photorealistic outputs for high-resolution images with arbitrary large-region masks remains difficult. Inpainted images often suffer from deformed structures and blurry textures, compromising quality. Additionally, building a model capable of handling a diverse range of images presents further challenges. These challenges are addressed by proposing a novel probabilistic model that utilizes picture priors to learn prominent features within StyleGAN3. The priors are constructed using cosine similarity, mean, and intensity, where intensity is computed using the improved Papoulis-Gerchberg algorithm. The image is reconstructed using the probabilistic maximum a posteriori estimate. Variational inference is then applied to obtain the optimal solution using a modified Bayes-by-Backprop approach. The model is evaluated on 70,000 images from the Flickr-Faces-HQ, DIV2K, and brain datasets and surpasses state-of-the-art techniques in reconstruction quality.",

    "abstract": "We present the Swedish Medical LLM Benchmark (SMLB), an evaluation framework for assessing large language models (LLMs) in the Swedish medical domain. The SMLB addresses the lack of language-specific, clinically relevant benchmarks by incorporating four datasets: translated PubMedQA questions, Swedish Medical Exams, Emergency Medicine scenarios, and General Medicine cases. Our evaluation of 18 state-of-the-art LLMs reveals GPT-4-turbo, Claude- 3.5 (October 2023), and the o3model as top performers, demonstrating a strong alignment between medical reasoning and general language understanding capabilities. Hybrid systems incorporating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) improved accuracy for clinical knowledge questions, highlighting promising directions for safe implementation. The SMLB provides not only an evaluation tool but also reveals fundamental insights about LLM capabilities and limitations in Swedish healthcare applications, including significant performance variations between models. By open-sourcing the benchmark, we enable transparent assessment of medical LLMs while promoting responsible development through community-driven refinement. This study emphasizes the critical need for rigorous evaluation frameworks as LLMs become increasingly integrated into clinical workflows, particularly in non-English medical contexts where linguistic and cultural specificity are paramount.",

    "abstract": "Manual diagnostic methods for assessing exercise-induced laryngeal obstruction (EILO) contain human bias and can lead to subjective decisions.

Four state-of-the-art models for laryngeal image segmentation are implemented, trained, and compared using our pre-processed dataset containing laryngeal images derived from continuous laryngoscopy exercise-test (CLE-test) data. These models include both convolutional-based and transformer-based methods. We propose a new framework called LarynxFormer, consisting of a pre-processing pipeline, transformer-based segmentation, and post-processing of laryngeal images. This study contributes to the investigation of using machine learning as a diagnostic tool for EILO. Furthermore, we show that a transformer-based approach for larynx segmentation outperforms conventional state-of-the-art image segmentation methods in terms of performance metrics and computational speed, demonstrating up to 2x faster inference time compared to the other methods.",
