    "abstract": "In recent years, the emergence of large language models (LLMs), particularly the advent of ChatGPT, has positioned natural language sequence-based representation learning and generative models as the dominant research paradigm in AI for science. Within the domains of drug discovery and computational chemistry, compound representation learning and molecular generation stand out as two of the most significant tasks. Currently, the predominant molecular representation sequences used for molecular characterization and generation include SMILES (Simplified Molecular-Input Line-Entry System), SELFIES (SELF-referencing Embedded Strings), SMARTS (Smiles Arbitrary Target Specification), and IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) nomenclature. In the context of AI-assisted drug design, each of these molecular languages has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the granularity of information encoded by different molecular representation forms varies significantly. However, the selection of an appropriate molecular representation as the input format for model training is crucial, yet this issue has not been thoroughly explored. Furthermore, the state-of-the-art models currently employed for molecular generation and optimization are diffusion models. Therefore, this study investigates the characteristics of the four mainstream molecular representation languages within the same diffusion model for training generative molecular sets. First, a single molecule is represented in four different ways through varying methodologies, followed by training a denoising diffusion model using identical parameters. Subsequently, thirty thousand molecules are generated for evaluation and analysis. The results indicate that the four molecular representation languages exhibit both similarities and differences in attribute distribution and spatial distribution; notably, SELFIES and SMARTS demonstrate a high degree of similarity, while IUPAC and SMILES show substantial differences. Additionally, IUPAC's primary advantage lies in the novelty and diversity of generated molecules, whereas SMILES excels in QEPPI and SAscore metrics, with SELFIES and SMARTS performing best on the QED metric. The findings of this research will provide crucial insights into the selection of molecular representations in AI drug design tasks, thereby contributing to enhanced efficiency in drug development.",

    "abstract": "Drug repurposing offers a promising alternative to traditional drug development and significantly reduces costs and timelines by identifying new therapeutic uses for existing drugs. However, the current approaches often rely on limited data sources and simplistic hypotheses, which restrict their ability to capture the multi-faceted nature of biological systems. This study introduces adaptive multi-view learning (AMVL), a novel methodology that integrates chemical-induced transcriptional profiles (CTPs), knowledge graph (KG) embeddings, and large language model (LLM) representations, to enhance drug repurposing predictions. AMVL incorporates an innovative similarity matrix expansion strategy and leverages multi-view learning (MVL), matrix factorization, and ensemble optimization techniques to integrate heterogeneous multi-source data. Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark datasets (Fdataset, Cdataset, and Ydataset) and the large-scale iDrug dataset demonstrate that AMVL outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, achieving superior accuracy in predicting drug-disease associations across multiple metrics. Literature-based validation further confirmed the model's predictive capabilities, with seven out of the top ten predictions corroborated by post-2011 evidence. To promote transparency and reproducibility, all data and codes used in this study were open-sourced, providing resources for processing CTPs, KG, and LLM-based similarity calculations, along with the complete AMVL algorithm and benchmarking procedures. By unifying diverse data modalities, AMVL offers a robust and scalable solution for accelerating drug discovery, fostering advancements in translational medicine and integrating multi-omics data. We aim to inspire further innovations in multi-source data integration and support the development of more precise and efficient strategies for advancing drug discovery and translational medicine.",

    "abstract": "The need for secure communication systems has driven extensive research into quantum-based security mechanisms, particularly Quantum Key Distribution (QKD). However, traditional QKD systems, within dynamic environments incorporating network fluctuation and attacks, have been relatively limited because static protocols cannot support high key generation rates and security. This work addresses these challenges by proposing the integration of AI and machine learning optimization techniques into quantum communication protocols to enhance both security and efficiency. We here propose three advanced models: first, Deep Reinforcement Learning is applied to adaptively optimize QKD protocols by dynamically adjusting the key generation parameters with respect to environmental conditions. In the state-of-the-art method, the DRL-based approach enlarges the secure key generation rate by 15-20 % and suppresses QBER 30-40 % under noisy conditions. A VAE is used for the detection of anomalies in quantum networks that effectively detects eavesdropping. By incorporating quantum-specific feature extraction and latent variable disentanglement, the VAE model detects attack detection accuracy of 85-90 % with a reduction of 25 % in false positives. Finally, it considers the optimization of cryptographic protocols in a distributed quantum network using Multi-Agent Deep Q-Networks. This multi-agent system strengthens both the security and computational efficiency by reducing attack vulnerabilities by 15-18 % and lowering the computational complexity by 20-25 %. In all, the integration of AI with machine learning methods brings far better enhancements in the field of quantum communication system security and efficiency, addressing critical limitations of conventional QKD systems and pointing to the way to more resilient adaptive quantum security solutions.",

This review systematically analyzes 28 studies on the application of machine learning techniques for the early detection of suicidal ideation. Among these, Random Forest and SVM emerged as the most commonly used algorithms, featured in 35 % and 27 % of studies respectively. Reported model accuracies ranged from 70 % to 95 %, with deep learning approaches showing slightly higher average precision and recall values. Most studies relied on survey-based data (68 %) and employed PHQ-9 or GAD-7 scales for input features. This review highlights existing gaps in cross-cultural generalization and calls for the development of interpretable and hybrid models for improved risk prediction.This review aims to conduct a comprehensive examination of the etiological factors contributing to the development of suicidal thoughts in students, with the goal of enabling early detection through the application of AI and machine learning techniques.This paper aims to review the current state-of-the-art, highlight the limitations, and emphasizes the need to shift toward hybrid and ensemble deep learning models, which have shown early promise but lack extensive analysis in current literature.",

    "abstract": "The age-related decline of fertility is caused by a reduction of the ovarian reserve, which is represented by the number and quality of oocytes in the ovaries. Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) is considered one of the most useful markers of the quantity of the ovarian reserve; however, a more accurate prediction method is required. Furthermore, there is no clinically useful tool to assess the quality of the ovarian reserve and therefore a prediction tool is required. Our aim is to produce a model for prediction of the ovarian reserve that contributes to preconception care and precision medicine. This study was a retrospective analysis of 442 patients undergoing assisted reproductive technology (ART) treatment in Japan from June 2021 to January 2023. Medical records and residual serum of patients undergoing oocyte retrieval were collected. Binary classification models predicting the ovarian reserve were created using machine learning methods developed with many collected feature values. The best-performing model among 15 examined models was selected based on its area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and accuracy. To maximize performance, feature values used for model creation were narrowed down and extracted. The best-performing model to assess the quantity of the ovarian reserve was the random forest model with an AUC of 0.9101. Five features were selected to create the model and consisted of data from only medical records. The best-performing model to assess the quality of the ovarian reserve was the random forest model, which had an AUC of 0.7983 and was created with 14 features, data from medical records and residual serum analysis. Our models are more accurate than currently popular methods for predicting the ovarian reserve. Furthermore, they can assess the ovarian reserve using only information obtained from a medical interview and single blood sampling. Enabling easy measurement of the ovarian reserve with this model would allow a greater number of women to engage in preconception care and facilitate the delivery of personalized medical treatment for patients undergoing infertility therapy.

    "abstract": "To study whether AI-driven oocyte evaluation is associated with blastocyst development and quality in couples with severe male factor infertility (SMF) undergoing intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycles. Cohort study SUBJECTS: 14,602 oocyte images from 2,156 ICSI cycles performed between January 2020 and May 2024 in a private university-affiliated in vitro fertilization center. Cycles were categorized into two groups: SMF (n=200 cycles, 1,478 embryos) and non-SMF (n=1,956 cycles, 13,124 embryos). SMF was defined as <5 million sperm in the ejaculate. Oocyte images were captured before ICSI and scored using the AI tool MAGENTA™. The predictive value of Magenta Scores (MS) on embryonic development was assessed. The association between MS and oocyte fertilization and blastocyst formation was analyzed. Oocyte fertilization, blastulation rate, blastocyst quality. MS were significantly lower in oocytes that failed to fertilize compared to those that successfully fertilized (5.00 ± 0.04 vs. 6.44 ± 0.03, p<0.001). Blastulation rate was lower in the SMF group (46.61% vs. 50.80%, p=0.003), and blastocysts exhibited higher MS than non-blastocysts (5.12 ± 0.3 vs. 6.69 ± 0.3, p<0.001). The top-quality blastocyst rate was lower in SMF (56.6% vs. 65.2%, p<0.001), and high-quality blastocysts had higher MS than lower-quality ones (7.2 ± 0.6 vs. 6.8 ± 0.5, p<0.001). Among SMF cycles, MS were lower in oocytes that failed to fertilize (4.91 ± 0.12 vs. 6.34 ± 0.10, p<0.001). MS also differed between embryos that reached the blastocyst stage and those that did not (6.70 ± 0.11 vs. 4.96 ± 0.10, p<0.001). Top-quality blastocysts had significantly higher MS than others (7.00 ± 0.21 vs. 6.39 ± 0.19, p<0.001). Paternal age negatively correlated with fertilization, blastulation, and blastocyst quality; however, differences remained significant after adjusting for paternal age. AI-based oocyte evaluation is associated with fertilization, blastulation, and blastocyst quality in SMF couples undergoing ICSI cycles. MS values were consistently higher for blastocysts than non-blastocysts, demonstrating the AI tool's utility in identifying oocytes with greater developmental potential, regardless of male infertility factors. However, the absence of sperm-specific factors in the MAGENTA™ algorithm may limit its ability to fully account for male infertility.",

    "abstract": "Visible-infrared person re-identification (VIPR) poses significant challenges due to the inherent differences between visible and infrared images. These differences result in lower similarity among individuals of the same identity across modalities and higher similarity among different identities within the same modality. Existing methods often struggle to effectively address this issue, as they fail to capture global similarity metrics with limited training data, which hinders the model's ability to learn discriminative features. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel approach called memory-augmented shuffled meta (MASM) learning. Our approach is distinguished by two key components: shuffled meta learning (SML) and memory meta learning (MML). SML constructs diverse query and support sets in each training cycle, allowing the model to learn from a wide range of data inputs. Meanwhile, MML leverages historical information stored in memory banks to capture long-term dependencies. This strategic combination of SML and MML not only enhances data utilization but also empowers the model to learn comprehensive global meta metrics, significantly improving its ability to distinguish individuals across modalities. Extensive experiments on the RegDB and SYSU-MM01 datasets validate the effectiveness of our MASM method, demonstrating its superiority over several state-of-the-art approaches.",

    "abstract": "Online learning has demonstrated superiority in connecting high-quality educational resources to a global audience. To ensure an excellent learning experience with sustainable and opportune learning instructions, online learning systems must comprehend learners' evolving knowledge states based on their learning interactions, known as the Knowledge Tracing (KT) task. Generally, learners practice through various quizzes, each comprising several exercises that cover similar knowledge concepts. Therefore, their learning interactions are continuous within each quiz but discrete across different quizzes. However, existing methods overlook the quiz structure and assume all learning interactions are uniformly distributed. We argue that learners' knowledge states should also be assessed in quiz since they practiced in quiz. To achieve this goal, we present a novel Quiz-based Knowledge Tracing (QKT) model, which effectively integrates the quiz structure of learning interactions. This is achieved by designing two distinct modules by neural networks: one for intra-quiz modeling and another for inter-quiz fusion. Extensive experimental results on public real-world datasets demonstrate that QKT achieves new state-of-the-art performance. The findings of this study suggest that incorporating the quiz structure of learning interactions can efficiently comprehend learners' knowledge states with fewer quizzes, and provides valuable insights into designing effective quizzes with fewer exercises.",

In particular, in order to mitigate the significant programming energy overheads for large-scale memristor arrays and the reliance on high-precision analog-to-digital-converter (ADC) in compute-in-memory operations, a novel mixed-precision weight mapping strategy is adopted. Compared with traditional schemes, the ADC modules achieve up to a 22.3× reduction in energy consumption while maintaining equivalent network performance. Ultimately, this memristive in-memory object detection system demonstrates 4,180× higher energy efficiency and 228× greater computational throughput compared to GPU implementations.",

    "abstract": "High-grade patterns (HGPs) are important for surgical decision-making in patients with invasive lung adenocarcinoma (IAC), but the sensitivity of intraoperative frozen section (FS) is not high. Radiomics has the potential to improve the sensitivity of intraoperative detection. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the value of combining radiomics with FS analysis for predicting HGPs in patients with clinical T1 (cT1) IAC. Data from a total of 490 patients who were surgically diagnosed with IAC from January 2019 to April 2019 were retrospectively analyzed; the patients were randomly divided into a training set (n=392) and a test set (n=98). The presence of HGPs (micropapillary, solid, and complex glandular patterns) was evaluated according to the final pathology (FP). Radiomics features were extracted from thin-slice computed tomography (CT) images, and feature selection was performed via the mutual information method and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression algorithm. The radiomics (R), FS, and radiomics-frozen section (R-FS) models were established to predict the presence of HGPs in FP. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, the precision-recall curve, the calibration curve, and decision curve analysis were used to evaluate model performances. The permutation importance algorithm (PIA) and local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) were used to provide interpretations for the R model. Additionally, the predictive performance was compared among tumors with different CT densities. The R and R-FS models outperformed the FS model, with the R-FS model achieving the best area under the curve value of 0.907 (95% confidence interval: 0.830-0.956) in the test set. PIA and LIME determined the interpretability of outputs from both the overall model and individual sample perspectives. Among the three models, the R model performed best in pure ground-glass nodules and pure-solid tumors. Radiomics could function as a complementary check to FS to provide a more sensible and accurate intraoperative identification of HGPs as compared to the use of FS alone, thus better informing clinical decision-making.",
